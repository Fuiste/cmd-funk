# Command Funk

A command line framework without training wheels.

## Why use Command Funk?

- **Functional:** To the extent that it is reasonable, Command Funk doesn't explocitly track state. There's no classes, minimal initialization, as little overhead as possible.
- **Modern:** Command Funk is written in Typescript and takes advantage of `async/await`, so no outdated access patterns!

## Installation

Use your favorite package manager and install `cmd-funk`, for example:

```bash
npm install cmd-funk
```
